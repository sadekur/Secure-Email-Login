== Secure Email Login ==  
A powerful and easy-to-use WordPress CRM plugin for lead management, email automation, and much more!  

== Description ==  
**Secure Email Login** Secure Email Login transforms the traditional WordPress login experience by enabling passwordless authentication. This innovative plugin allows existing users to log in using just their email address. New users can also register seamlessly through a secure, OTP-based process. Upon entering their email, they receive a One-Time Password (OTP) with a 10-minute validity. A user-friendly interface prompts them to enter their name (optional) and the received OTP to complete the registration or login process.  

> **Note**: This plugin requires PHP 7.2 or higher.  

### Key Features:  
- **Passwordless Login**: Users can log in using only their email, eliminating the need to remember passwords.  
- **OTP Verification**: Enhances security by verifying user identity with a time-limited OTP sent via email.  
- **Auto Registration**: New users can register on-the-fly during their first login attempt, with no need for a pre-registration process.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a streamlined login experience with minimal user input required.  
- **Enhanced Security**: Reduces the risk of password theft and enhances user authentication security.

### Why Choose Secure Email Login?  
- Eliminates Password Hassles: Forget about managing complex passwords or dealing with password resets. Secure Email Login removes the barriers to entry by using a simple yet secure email-based login process.
- Enhanced Security and Privacy: By using OTPs, Secure Email Login minimizes the risk of password theft and unauthorized access. Each OTP is uniquely generated and valid for only 10 minutes, ensuring that only the intended user can log in during that window. 
- Streamlined User Experience: Users appreciate ease and efficiency. Secure Email Login reduces the friction of traditional login methods by providing a smooth, two-step process that quickly authenticates users without the need for passwords.
- Increased User Registration: The quick and easy registration process encourages new users to sign up without the typical resistance of filling out long forms. This can lead to higher conversion rates and increased user engagement.
- Lower Support Overhead: Reducing dependency on passwords decreases the number of support requests related to login issues like forgotten passwords and account lockouts. This can significantly lower support costs and reduce administrative overhead.
- Future-Proof Technology: As the digital landscape evolves towards more secure and user-friendly authentication methods, Secure Email Login ensures your site remains ahead of the curve by adopting these advanced security practices now.
